This website is a project example for the 2018 Day of Digital Humanities at the University of North Texas.  

While I'll use the site to host a number of projects, it's current focus is on the Samuel Richardson novel, *Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded* first published in 1740. Although this novel was not initially published as a serial, its epistolary format easily translates into separate blog posts.  

This website was built using the following resources:

And with information from the following tutorials:
